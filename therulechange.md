# The Rule Change
> School Assignment - Short Story based on novel.

“An A!?” At first I thought it was an error. “In history!?” I was impressed of my feat. I kind of expected something above a C since I already knew a fair bit about Anh Do. The world around me congratulated me, constantly chanting my name. That night, I was on my computer playing Habbo. While I sat at one of the helpdesks ready to help a fellow player, I thought about my assessment, which got me thinking: How could I allow all refugees to come in to Australia? Then it hit me.

I opened Facebook and made a new page, my friend Beth messaged me, asking what I was doing. Beth’s one of my online friends. She has pink hair, blue eyes, soft no-tag clothing, a fluff ball lanyard and headphones. She calls it her out-and-about look.

“I’m going to make a change to the refugee rule,” I replied. “AYC1!?” she hastefully replied. “Mmmmmmaybe a bit!” I joked. “Not without my help you aren’t!”. I knew she would jump on board fast. She agreed to make the art for my campaign, especially because she’s great at drawing. I invited all my friends to like my page. Over the course of a week, we had around 2.6k likes, follows and shares.

But then at 5 o’clock on a Saturday morning, I got an email from the PM.
```
Dear Harrison,
I congratulate you on your campaign. If you like, I’d be delighted to have a debate with you.
I hope to see you there!
~PM

I knew it was early, but I didn’t hesitate to tell Beth about this. “What!? That’s crazy!” she exclaimed, even though you really can’t ‘exclaim’ with instant messaging. “Should I go or not?” “Well, duh! You should!” “But I’d need to get up early!” “Go to bed earlier!” “We need to fly all the way to Canberra!” “The PM probably has that covered.” “It’s on a school day,” “Do you really think school will stop you?” She had a point. And so, I made my decision.
```
Dear PM,
Two words: I’m in.
Can’t wait!
~Harry
